The 3 queries we are going to compare are:
    * Query 2 (Q2): code optim for space effici
    * Query 3 (Q3): parallel algorithm
    * Query 6 (Q6): perform evalu and model of comput system

These 3 queries were chosen because it represented the shortest query available and the longest query available
for comparison. Q2 was chosen because it was the query closest to the median query length. The 3 retrieval systems
that are going to be compared are BM25, TF-IDF, and Lucene.

Q2:

    The top 5 results between BM25 and Lucene overlapped significantly. Each of the top 5 results appeared
    in each result set, the main difference was in ordering. The only document that had the same rank in the
    top 5 between these two systems was CACM-2748 which was ranked #2 in each. None of the top 5 documents
    from BM25/Lucene appeared in the top 5 list in the TF-IDF system.

    Once we begin to look at the top 10 results from each system things start to get a little more
    interesting. Out of the top 10 results between BM25 and Lucene the systems overlapped in 6 / 10
    documents, as you see the two start to deviate once we start comparing more of the result set. Out of
    the top 10 results between BM25 and TF-IDF overlapped in 1 / 10 documents. You start to see the impact
    of the parameter tuning we get with BM25 come into effect. Out of the top 10 results between
    Lucene and TF-IDF overlapped in 2 / 10 documents.

    The deviation in results retrieved between each of the systems grew as more documents are cross
    compared.

Q3:

    The top 5 results between BM25 and Lucene overlapped partially. Out of the top 5 results 3 / 5
    documents appeared in each retrieval result set. In addition to that the top 2 documents were ranked in the
    same order, and those documents were CACM-2714 and CACM-2973, with ranks #1 and #2 respectively.
    The top 5 results between BM25 and TF-IDF had a minor overlap, 1 / 5 documents appeared in each
    retrieval set. The top 5 results between Lucene and TF-IDF had a minor overlap, 1 / 5 documents
    appeared in each retrieval set. All three systems had the same overall #1 ranked document which
    was CACM-2714.

    Once we begin to look at the top 10 results from each system things start to get a little more
    interesting. Out of the top 10 results between BM25 and Lucene the systems overlapped in 7 / 10
    documents, the deviation was not as large as compared to Q2. The documents were CACM-2714, CACM-3075,
    CACM-2973, CACM-2256, CACM-0950, CACM-2433, and CACM-2785, ordering of results were different.

    Out of the top 10 results between BM25 and TF-IDF overlapped in 6 / 10 documents. Those documents
    were CACM-2714, CACM-2973, CACM-0950, CACM-2433, CACM-2289, and CACM-2785. Ordering of the results
    were different. Rank #1 and #10 were the same between these two systems.

    Out of the top 10 results between Lucene and TF-IDF overlapped in 5 / 10 documents. Those documents
    were CACM-2714, CACM-2973, CACM-0950, CACM-2433, and CACM-2785. Ordering of the results
    were different. Rank #1 and #10 were the same between these two systems.

Q6:

    The top 5 results between BM25 and Lucene overlapped significantly. Each of the top 5 results appeared
    in each result set and the rankings were the same. CACM-2318, CACM-3048, CACM-3070, CACM-2741, and
    CACM-2319. BM25/ Lucene retrieval systems overlapped with the TF-IDF system in 2 / 5 the top 5
    documents. The the documents that overlapped were the first two results, CACM-2318, CACM-3048, but
    ordering was different.

    Once we begin to look at the top 10 results from each system things start to get a little more
    interesting. Out of the top 10 results between BM25 and Lucene the systems overlapped in 9 / 10
    documents. However the biggest difference is that ordering in which these documents appear begin to change.
    The 9 documents that overlapped were the same ones mentioned earlier in addition to the following
    documents CACM-3119, CACM-2894, CACM-3089, and CACM-2542. The only document that had the same ranking
    in both systems was CACM-2542 at rank #9.

    Out of the top 10 results between BM25 and TF-IDF overlapped in 5 / 10 documents. These documents were
    CACM-2318, CACM-3048, CACM-3070, CACM-2319, and CACM-2542. The ordering of these documents were different
    between these two systems.

    Out of the top 10 results between Lucene and TF-IDF overlapped in 5 / 10 documents. Those documents
    were CACM-2318, CACM-3048, CACM-3070, CACM-2319, and CACM-2542. Ordering of the results
    were different. Rank #1 and #10 were the same between these two systems.

    Out of the three runs selected to analyze, this run had the most similarity of retrieved documents
    in the top 10 results. Its interesting to note that this query was also the longest query available. Without
    looking at the documents contents, we believe these documents have a high amount of the query terms
    present in the document.
