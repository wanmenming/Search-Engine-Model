The query refinement technique used for this project was Pseudo Relevance Feedback to expand the query on the JM Smoothed Query Likelihood retrieval model. The algorithm for refinement was inspired from the textbooks Information Retrieval in Practice by Croft Et al. and Introduction to Information Retrieval by Manning et al. We selected the top 10 documents from the ranked list. 10 was chosen because users in real life will typically see a limited subset of results, and since the document length in this corpus was pretty small with the average document length being ~74 words we selected the top 16% of terms present from these documents, which came out to be ~11.84, which resulted in us picking the top 12 terms from these documents to use for query expansion.
