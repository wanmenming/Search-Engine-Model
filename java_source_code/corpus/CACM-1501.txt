eigenvectors of a 2 n x 2 n matrix it has been known that the eigenvalues of a certain 2 n x 2 n matrix can be obtained by use of two smaller matrices of order n which can be easily constructed an algorithm is given to obtain the eigenvectors of the 2 n x 2 n matrix by use of the eigenvectors of the smaller matrices cacm december 1967 charmonman s ca671207 jb february 26 1978 2 22 pm
