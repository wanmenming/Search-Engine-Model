A simple mechanism is described for the execution
of part of a program with its own <b>memory</b> 
protection.  This allows such a program to act as a
suboperating system.  An improved version ...<br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>Doc ID: CACM-2486 </i><br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  formulas placed partly at the end of
