The Mobile Programming System: STAGE2

STAGE2 is the second <b>level</b> of a bootstrap sequence which
is easily implemented on any computer.  It is a flexible,
provided ...<br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>Doc ID: CACM-2003 </i><br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  design process, are presented.  The main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two <b>high level</b> user oriented
languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction
is based.  ...<br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>Doc ID: CACM-1475 </i><br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  applications employ sequential
magnetic tape rather than random-access storage 
techniques to process a <b>very</b> small number of transactions
against a voluminous master file.  In such 
situations, it may prove ...<br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>Doc ID: CACM-2365 </i><br /><br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  the order of nested loops.  Such modifications
produce modest savings in many common situations 
and <b>very</b> significant savings for large problems run
under an operating system which uses paging.

lower level code by a sequence of steps.  Each 
step expands <b>high</b>er level statements into blocks of
